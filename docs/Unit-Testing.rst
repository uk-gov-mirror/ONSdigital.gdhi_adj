Unit tests are located in the ``tests/`` directory and are written using the ``pytest`` package. See `test_example.py <https://gitlab-app-l-01/EPDS/rap-project-example/-/blob/stable/tests/test_example.py>`_ for an example of a unit test, that also works when run. To run the tests, execute ``pytest`` from the command line. Note that Jenkins cannot access the HDFS, so any unit tests that use data from the HDFS will fail. A mocking utility such as ``mock`` or ``monkeypatch`` can be used to avoid this. There is also the predefined ``@hdfs_skip`` decorator, defined in `conf_test.py <https://gitlab-app-l-01/EPDS/rap-project-example/-/blob/stable/tests/conftest.py>`_, which tells Jenkins to skip a test and logs the reason it was skipped.
